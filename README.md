<h1>Overview</h1>
<img src="Img/preview (2).png" alt="Description of image"><br>

Welcome to the Campus Feedback System, a web application built with Java and a variety of powerful frameworks. This system allows students to provide feedback on various campus services, courses, and facilities. It aims to streamline the process of gathering and analyzing student feedback to help improve campus services.<br>

<h2>Features 🚀</h2><br>
✅ Real-time Feedback Submission – Allow students to provide feedback on different aspects of the campus.<br>
✅ Feedback Analysis – Automatically process and analyze feedback to identify trends.<br>
✅ User-friendly Interface – Easy-to-use interface for both students and campus administrators.<br>
✅ Data Storage – Stores feedback data securely in a relational database.<br>
✅ Multi-platform Support – Accessible across different devices (web, mobile, tablet).<br>

<h2>Tech Stack 🛠️</h2>
<h3>Java – The core language used for the backend logic of the system.</h3>

<h3>Spring Boot – A Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.</h3>

<h3>Spring MVC – For building the web layer and handling HTTP requests and responses.</h3>

<h3>Hibernate – For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to handle database transactions.</h3>

<h3>MySQL – Relational database to store the feedback data.</h3>

<h3>HTML/CSS/JS – For frontend development, creating a responsive and dynamic user interface.</h3>

<h1>Chatting Application using Java RMI 💬🖥️</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<img src="Img/preview.png" alt="Description of image">

Welcome to the Chatting Application built using **Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**. This application allows users to chat in real-time across multiple devices, with features such as private messaging, message history, and real-time updates. The app uses RMI to handle communication between clients and the server.<br>

<h2>Features 🚀</h2><br>
✅ **Real-time Messaging** – Send and receive messages instantly.<br>
✅ **Private Messaging** – Send private messages to other users.<br>
✅ **Message History** – View previous messages.<br>
✅ **User Authentication** – Log in to your account and chat with others.<br>
✅ **Multiple Clients** – Supports multiple users simultaneously.<br>

<h2>Tech Stack 🛠️</h2>
<h3>Java RMI – For remote method invocation between clients and server, enabling distributed communication.</h3>

<h3>Java – The core language used to develop the application logic.</h3>

<h3>Java Swing – For building a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for the client-side application.</h3>

<h3>MySQL – For storing user information and message history.</h3>

<h3>RMI Registry – For binding and locating remote objects for communication.</h3>
